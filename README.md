# Itunes Browser

This is a "practice app" I've done to train my coding skills. 

## What does this app do?

This small app pulls data from the Itunes API, and retrives both the top 100 songs and albuns. The user can see the order, the price (be redirected to the app store if they want to), select items on their search and mark their favorite songs. The search also displays the items in alphabetical order when the input is clicked. And the favorite function retrieves a list with the user's checked list item's elements. 


## What was used to put this app together?

The app was generated with Create React App and for coding I used the react framwork on its latest version (including hooks). For the UI, I used material UI with a custom theme and for styling, I used styled components. For testing it uses the integrated jest set up (from create react app) with the behavavioural approach brought from react-testing-library (the test suit still needs to be properly finished).
